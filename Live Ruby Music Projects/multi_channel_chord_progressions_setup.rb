# This is the Start of A Generating Music and Midi files using Ruby code plan on building
# more features like better chord system user controls please feel to add features that you think 
# should be added.. to  feature to do list 

# DON'T FORGET YOU MUST HAVE THE MIDILIB GEM INSTALLED   gem install midilib  

# Features to do List 
#     
#     let user choose number of melody tracks to generate
#     let user choose number of chord tracks to generate
#     build a Better way of calling scales and chords ( instead of hardcoding them )
